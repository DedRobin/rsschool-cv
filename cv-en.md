## About me
I started getting interested in programming in 2021, starting with backend development in Python. In the process of studying, I realized that I spend more time on the visual part of applications and decided 
 to study the Frontend direction.

My perseverance and dedication to the process, responsibility, attention to detail, and determination help me solve problems. 

I am looking for a place with a friendly and cohesive team where I can unlock my potential, develop as a specialist, and improve my soft and hard skills.
